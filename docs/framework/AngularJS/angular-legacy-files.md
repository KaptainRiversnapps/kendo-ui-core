# AngularJS Legacy Files

As of the Kendo R3 SP1 2023 release, following the deprecation of the AngularJS library, the related script files are no longer distributed through the Kendo bundle. If you still rely on AngularJS and need to include the files, you can find them in the R3 2023 package. To download the files, go to your [Telerik Account](https://www.telerik.com/account/) -> Downloads -> Kendo UI for jQuery. Select version 2023.3.1010 and download the commercial-source.zip.
